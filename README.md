# Dynamic Project: Early Childhood in Peru, CunaMas

This repo holds the final dynamic project for Andrew McNutt's "Data Visualization for Policy Analysis" class for the Winter2021 quarter. This project focuses on CunaMas, one of the five national social programs in Peru under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Inclusion and Social Development (MIDIS). The program was created in 2008. It is in charge of early childhood development by giving free childcare services to children between 0-5 years and family assistance services where mothers learn about nutrition, upbringing, etc.

The project explores the evolution and gaps in the program's coverage between 2009-2019, disaggregating by natural regions. In the last step of the display, an interactive plot is presented, showing the potential effects the program may have had on maternal health, female labor participation, and children's anemia.
